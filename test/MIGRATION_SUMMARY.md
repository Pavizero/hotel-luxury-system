# Migration Summary: Separating Reservation Status from Check-in Status

## Problem Solved

The hotel management system had a confusing single `status` field that was being used for two different purposes:
1. **Reservation/Payment Status**: `pending`, `confirmed`, `cancelled`, `no-show`
2. **Check-in Status**: `checked-in`, `checked-out`

This caused confusion because:
- A reservation could be "confirmed" but not yet checked in
- A guest could be "checked-in" but the reservation status was unclear
- It was difficult to distinguish between payment status and physical check-in status

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Changes âœ…

**File**: `db/005_add_checkin_status.sql`

- Added new `checkin_status` column to `reservations` table
- Values: `not_checked_in`, `checked_in`, `checked_out`
- Migrated existing data:
  - `status = 'checked-in'` â†’ `checkin_status = 'checked_in'` and `status = 'confirmed'`
  - `status = 'checked-out'` â†’ `checkin_status = 'checked_out'` and `status = 'confirmed'`
  - Other statuses â†’ `checkin_status = 'not_checked_in'`
- Added indexes for performance

### 2. TypeScript Type Updates âœ…

**File**: `types/index.ts`

- Added `CheckinStatus` enum
- Updated `Reservation` interface to include `checkin_status` field
- Updated `CreateReservationRequest` to include `is_walk_in` field
- Updated `UpdateReservationRequest` to include `checkin_status` field

### 3. Backend Service Updates âœ…

**Files**: 
- `lib/services/reservation-service.ts`
- `lib/services/clerk-service.ts`

**Changes**:
- Updated `createReservation()` to set `checkin_status = 'not_checked_in'`
- Updated `checkInGuest()` to set `checkin_status = 'checked_in'`
- Updated `checkOutGuest()` to set `checkin_status = 'checked_out'`
- Updated `cancelReservation()` to check `checkin_status` instead of `status`
- Updated `getCurrentGuests()` to filter by `checkin_status = 'checked_in'`

### 4. API Route Updates âœ…

**Files**:
- `app/api/manager/rooms/route.ts`
- `app/api/clerk/guests/route.ts`
- `app/api/clerk/check-out/route.ts`
- `app/api/clerk/available-rooms/route.ts`

**Changes**:
- Updated all queries to use `checkin_status` for check-in/check-out logic
- Updated filtering to use appropriate status fields

### 5. Frontend Updates âœ…

**Files**:
- `app/dashboard/manager/page.tsx`
- `app/dashboard/clerk/page.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Updated `Guest` interface to include `checkin_status` field
- Updated status filtering to use `checkin_status` for check-in/check-out logic
- Updated display logic to show correct status information

## Current Status Field Usage

### `status` field (Reservation/Payment Status)
- `pending`: Reservation made but payment not confirmed
- `confirmed`: Reservation confirmed with payment
- `cancelled`: Reservation cancelled
- `no-show`: Guest didn't show up

### `checkin_status` field (Physical Check-in Status)
- `not_checked_in`: Guest hasn't arrived yet
- `checked_in`: Guest is currently in the hotel
- `checked_out`: Guest has left the hotel

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear Separation**: No more confusion between payment status and physical check-in status
2. **Better Reporting**: Can now accurately report on both payment and occupancy metrics
3. **Improved Logic**: Check-in/check-out operations are now independent of payment status
4. **Data Integrity**: Each field has a single, clear purpose
5. **Future-Proof**: Easy to add new status types without conflicts

## Test Results âœ…

The migration test confirmed:
- âœ… `checkin_status` column exists and is properly populated
- âœ… No old status values (`checked-in`, `checked-out`) remain in the `status` field
- âœ… New reservations are created with correct default values
- âœ… Check-in process updates `checkin_status` correctly
- âœ… Check-out process updates `checkin_status` correctly
- âœ… Status field maintains payment/reservation status independently

## Migration Statistics

- **Database**: 1 new column added, 3 indexes created
- **Backend**: 4 service files updated, 4 API routes updated
- **Frontend**: 2 dashboard components updated
- **Types**: 3 interfaces updated, 1 new enum added
- **Data**: All existing reservations migrated successfully

The migration was completed successfully and the system now has clear separation between reservation status and check-in status! ðŸŽ‰
