# Bulk Travel Booking Check-In Fix

## 🐛 Problem Identified
When trying to check in bulk travel bookings, the system was asking for both reservation ID and room ID, but bulk bookings create multiple individual reservations that need separate room assignments.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Clerk Guests API**
**File:** `app/api/clerk/guests/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added `is_travel_company` field to identify travel bookings
- Added `display_name` field that shows "(Travel)" for travel bookings
- Enhanced SQL query to include travel booking indicators

```sql
SELECT 
  ...,
  r.is_travel_company,
  CASE 
    WHEN r.is_travel_company = 1 THEN CONCAT(u.name, ' (Travel)')
    ELSE u.name
  END as display_name
FROM reservations r
```

### 2. **Updated Clerk Dashboard Interface**
**File:** `app/dashboard/clerk/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `is_travel_company` and `display_name` to Guest interface
- Updated guest display to show travel booking indicators
- Enhanced search functionality to use display names
- Updated check-in dialog to show travel booking type

**Key Features:**
- Travel bookings show "(Travel)" in the name
- Blue "Travel Booking" badge for easy identification
- Check-in dialog shows travel booking type
- Each reservation in bulk booking appears separately

### 3. **Individual Reservation Handling**
**How it works:**
- Bulk bookings create multiple individual reservations
- Each reservation needs its own room assignment
- Clerk can check in each reservation individually
- Each reservation shows as a separate guest entry

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### For Bulk Travel Bookings (2+ rooms):
1. **Creation:** Creates multiple individual reservations
2. **Display:** Each reservation appears separately in clerk dashboard
3. **Check-in:** Clerk assigns room to each reservation individually
4. **Status:** Each reservation can be checked in/out independently

### Example Bulk Booking (3 rooms):
```
Travel Company: Luxury Tours Ltd (Travel)
├── Reservation 1: Room 101 (Standard)
├── Reservation 2: Room 102 (Standard)  
└── Reservation 3: Room 201 (Deluxe)
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Scenarios:
1. **Create bulk travel booking** (2+ rooms)
2. **Verify clerk dashboard** shows individual reservations
3. **Check-in each reservation** separately
4. **Verify travel booking indicators** are displayed

### Run Tests:
```bash
node test-clerk-travel-bookings.js
```

## ✅ Benefits

1. **Clear Identification:** Travel bookings are clearly marked
2. **Individual Control:** Each reservation can be managed separately
3. **Proper Room Assignment:** Each reservation gets its own room
4. **Consistent Workflow:** Same check-in process for all bookings
5. **Better UX:** Clerk can easily identify and manage travel bookings
